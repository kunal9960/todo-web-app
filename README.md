## Getting Started

Ensure you have the following installed:

- pip (Python package installer)
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for enabling the rapid development of web applications.

To run the Todo Web App locally, you'll need to have Streamlit installed. If you haven't already, you can install it via pip:

```
pip install streamlit
```

Once Streamlit is installed, you can launch the app by running the following command in your terminal:
```
streamlit run web.py
```

This will start a local server, and you can access the Todo Web App in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`
